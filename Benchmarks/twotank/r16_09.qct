# R09 If the tank 2 liquid height is greater than or equal to the
# placement height of the tank 2 HIGH liquid sensor then the sensor
# should return an active (TRUE) state to the system.

# NOTE: Sensors *should* be Boolean, BUT they are enetered as floats in the model.
# NOTE: max-time is important here (and probably should be reported by the tool).
