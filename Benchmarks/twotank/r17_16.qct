# R16 The tank 1 change in liquid volume for each timestep is limited by
# the maximum inflow and outflow for each timestep.
#
# The change in volume is (t1_h{t} - t1_h{t-1}) * tank1_cross_section_area_m2

# UPDATED: The original qct for this requirement did not take into account
#          the length of each timestep, which is represented by time_increment_s
