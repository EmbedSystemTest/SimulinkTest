# R08 If the tank 1 liquid height is below (less than) the placement
# height of the tank 1 LOW liquid sensor then the sensor should return a
# (FALSE) state to the system.

# NOTE: Sensors *should* be Boolean, BUT they are enetered as floats in the model.
# NOTE: max-time is important here (and probably should be reported by the tool).
